Tech Stack & Requirements:

Selenium 4.24.0
Java 17
Cucumber BDD framework
Page Object Model (POM) using @FindBy annotations
WebDriverManager 5.9.2 for driver setup
Extent Reports for reporting
Log4j 2.x for logging

POMxml file 
cucumber-java dependency version:- 7.18.1 
cucumber -junit dependency version: 7.18.1 
org junit jupiter dependency is not required 
org-apache.poi dependency version:-5.3.0 
replace poi-ooxml to poi-ooxml-schemas dependency version:- 4.12 
 dependency not required:-com.fasterxml.jackson.core

Maven project structure:

src/main/java/com/yourcompany/pages → Page Object classes for all major UI components and flows
src/main/java/com/yourcompany/utils → Utility classes (DriverManager, ConfigReader, LoggerUtil)
src/test/java/com/yourcompany/steps → Step definitions for all pages/components
src/test/java/com/yourcompany/runners → Test runner classes
src/test/java/com/yourcompany/hooks → Hooks for setup/teardown
src/test/resources/features → Feature files for all scenarios
src/test/resources/config → Config files (config.properties, log4j2.xml)
src/test/resources/testdata → Test data files (Excel, JSON)

All Page Objects must use @FindBy for locators and include logic to interact with UI elements (buttons, inputs, dropdowns, tables, etc.).
All step definitions must map Cucumber steps to Page Object methods and use config.properties for input values.
Implement positive and negative scenarios for all major flows (e.g., login, form submission, file upload, drag & drop, etc.).
Integrate Extent Reports and Log4j for reporting and logging.
Use config.properties for browser, baseURL, credentials, and all dynamic input values.
Ensure code is modular, maintainable, and follows best practices.

Instructions:

Automatically detect all major UI components and flows.
Scaffold the Maven project structure and generate all required code, config, and resource files.
Ensure all logic is implemented and ready to run.
Do not require any manual intervention.
All function used in the code must be utilized in the steps file.
